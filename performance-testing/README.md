# Performance Testing Scripts

## package.js

The package generated from this script contains all data that is essential for performing re-runnable a performance tests against OAE. The package will have these directories:

### csv/

This directory contains the CSV input data that can be fed into load testing user sessions. JMeter and Tsung should both be able to make use of this data. It will have these files:

**users.csv** contains (at most) 10 rows for each user that have a username, password and a group that user is a member of.
Columns: `username, password, group`


### source/

This contains a snapshot of the `scripts/` and `data/` directory from the model-loader that were used to generate the CSV data in the `csv/` directory. This data completes the package in such a way that the package can be re-used at any time to:

1. Reload the content into an empty OAE server at a later date
2. Perform iterative data-loading into the OAE container (e.g., load one batch at a time over a long period of time using something like `node loaddata.js -s 5 -b 6`)
3. Regenerate the CSV files that will work on different subsets of batches that were loaded into the server (e.g., only batches 0-3. Want to increase the data? Load 2 more and generate for batches 0-5)

While data-sets can be re-loaded, since it takes so long, it is not expected this would be the regular way to load data for all new performance tests. Instead, the servers will be reloaded from back-ups of data that was previously loaded.

### Sample Usage

Here is how `package.js` can be used to package re-usable testing data:

```console
OAE-model-loader$ node generate.js -b 10
